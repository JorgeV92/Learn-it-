# Learn-it-

This is a documentation of the process of learning and understanding algorithms and data structures, serving as a personal record of LeetCode questions. Most implementations will include more comments and descriptions than necessary. Initially, most implementations will be done in C++, but I will also work on an OCaml version to maintain my functional programming skills and continue growing my skill set with a meta-language. All resources will be credited and documented if I use solutions provided on the web, such as NeetCode.
